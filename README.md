# Floral-Fantasy
The remote workspace repository for my mod Floral Fantasy

Floral Fantasy is a mod that I am working on made entirely withing MCreator for Minecraft Jave Edition 1.16.5 (and 1.17+ once those versions come out)
Anyone is allowed to view and download these files for these purposes:
- Making an addon for the mod
- Making a separate mod using it as a basis
- Familiariasing yourself with Java and MCreator
- Personal/Private projects
- Other unlisted reasons (if the reason is not listed please contact me for permission before editing)
Anything not listed above would be considered as a violation of the license and I would humbly ask for you to take it down
